# Thoughts on engineering by engineers

A collection of writings by engineers about engineering. 



## What Engineers Know and How They Know It (Vincente)

This view of technology-and hence engineering-as other than science accords
with statements sometimes made by engineers, such as the following by a
British engineer to the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1922: "Aeroplanes are
not designed by science, but by art in spite of some pretence and humbug to
the contrary. I do not mean to suggest for one moment that engineering can do
without science, on the contrary, it stands on scientific foundations, but
there is a big gap between scientific researh and the engineering product
which has to be bridged by the art of the engineer." The creative,
constructive knowledge of the engineer is the knowledge needed to implement
that art. Technological knowledge in this view appears enormously richer and
more interesting than it does as applied science. (p4)


Engineering can, in fact, be defined in terms of these ends, as in the following quotation from
another British engineer, G.F.C. Rogers:

> Engineering refers to the practice of organizing the design and construction [and, I would add, operation] of any artifice which transforms the physical world around us to meet some recognized need. (p6)

## The Civilized Engineer (Florman)

Strictly speaking, the engineering profession came into being in the eigteenth century when science was first applied to the solution fo technical problems. But by adhering ot such a standard-by insisting tha twihtout scinece there is no engineering-we would exclude from our family tree many geniuses, from the builders fo the pyramids to the inventors of the steam engine, and this we refuse to do. (p26)

No matter how closely modern engineering becomes idetnified with science, no matter how electronic or theoretical its practice, no matter how much a group enterprise it may be, the end product of which seems remote and abstract, it can never be-should never be- servered from its origins in craftsmanship (p29).


 
## Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design

Excerpted from David Akin's website: <https://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/akins_laws.html>. These are the ones most relevant to software engineers.

Design is an iterative process. The necessary number of iterations is one more than the number you have currently done. This is true at any point in time.

Your best design efforts will inevitably wind up being useless in the final design. Learn to live with the disappointment.

Not having all the information you need is never a satisfactory excuse for not starting the analysis.

When in doubt, estimate. In an emergency, guess. But be sure to go back and clean up the mess when the real numbers come along.

Sometimes, the fastest way to get to the end is to throw everything out and start over.

There is never a single right solution. There are always multiple wrong ones, though.

(Shea's Law) The ability to improve a design occurs primarily at the interfaces. This is also the prime location for screwing it up.

Past experience is excellent for providing a reality check. Too much reality can doom an otherwise worthwhile design, though.

A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.

(Larrabee's Law) Half of everything you hear in a classroom is crap. Education is figuring out which half is which.

When in doubt, document. (Documentation requirements will reach a maximum shortly after the termination of a program.)

The schedule you develop will seem like a complete work of fiction up until the time your customer fires you for not meeting it.

It's called a "Work Breakdown Structure" because the Work remaining will grow until you have a Breakdown, unless you enforce some Structure on it.

(Varsi's Law) Schedules only move in one direction.

(von Tiesenhausen's Law of Program Management) To get an accurate estimate of final program requirements, multiply the initial time estimates by pi, and slide the decimal point on the cost estimates one place to the right.

(Atkin's Law of Demonstrations) When the hardware is working perfectly, the really important visitors don't show up.

(Patton's Law of Program Planning) A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.

(Roosevelt's Law of Task Planning) Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.

(de Saint-Exupery's Law of Design) A designer knows that they have achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

Any run-of-the-mill engineer can design something which is elegant. A good engineer designs systems to be efficient. A great engineer designs them to be effective.

(McBryan's Law) You can't make it better until you make it work.

There's never enough time to do it right, but somehow, there's always enough time to do it over.

You really understand something the third time you see it (or the first time you teach it.)
